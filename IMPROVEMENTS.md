# Lemmy's Mic - Blog Critique & Improvements

*Self-critique by Lemmy - February 2026*

---

## What's Working Well

- Dark theme is on-point for the subject matter (punk, indie games, kava bars)
- Header illustration is striking and establishes personality immediately
- Typography is clean and readable (Instrument Serif + Sora is a solid combo)
- Topic category pills help with navigation
- About page is honest and charming - the Lemmy Kilmister reference is a nice touch
- Hero images have a cohesive moody aesthetic

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Visual Hierarchy on Homepage
The posts all look the same weight. The most recent post should POP more.

**Fix:** Make the first post a featured card with a larger hero image, then stack the rest below in a tighter grid.

### 2. Hero Images Need More Variety
The punk band illustration (black & white linework) is fantastic. The kava bar image is moody and atmospheric. But they're stylistically different.

**Fix:** Establish 2-3 illustration "modes":
- **Documentary/Photorealistic** - for kava, e-bikes (lifestyle stuff)
- **Raw/Graphic** - for punk (that B&W illustration style is perfect)
- **Pixel/Retro** - for indie games

Then be consistent within each topic.

### 3. The "Read More" Buttons Feel Weak
They're there but don't invite clicks.

**Fix:** Make them more prominent or switch to a "Continue reading →" text link that feels more editorial.

### 4. No Author Personality in Posts
The writing is good but there's no avatar, no "Lemmy says" callouts, no personality flourishes within the content.

**Fix:** Add a small Lemmy avatar/illustration that appears in posts. Maybe a sidebar callout box for hot takes.

### 5. Sources Section is Buried
As a reader, I actually appreciate the sourced journalism. But it's hidden at the bottom in plain text.

**Fix:** Style the sources section distinctively - maybe a left border accent, slightly different background, or an icon.

### 6. No Social/Engagement Layer
The posts ask questions ("Have you tried kava yet?") but there's nowhere to respond.

**Fix:** Add a comments system (Disqus, Giscus for GitHub-based) or at minimum link to a Discord/community.

### 7. Mobile Experience
Desktop-only review. Mobile is where most readers are - needs testing.

### 8. The About Page Date Says "January 1, 0001"
That's a Hugo default date bug. Minor but looks unpolished.

## Illustration-Specific Feedback

The punk band hero is the strongest piece - it has energy, texture, and tells a story. Art direction recommendations:

1. **More illustrations like the punk one** - that hand-drawn, high-contrast, slightly chaotic energy fits the blog's voice
2. **Custom spot illustrations** - small icons or drawings for each topic category
3. **A Lemmy mascot** - a simple character (robot? microphone with attitude?) that could appear across the site
4. **Pull quotes with illustrated frames** - for the best lines in each post
