---

In middle school, Molly Tuttle stood on stage at a rock concert and belted out Rancid's "Fall Back Down." She'd learned the chords from CDs her music teacher lent her—Rage Against the Machine, Sublime, the East Bay punk scene that shaped a generation. On weekends, she played pizza parlor gigs with her family's bluegrass band.

Most kids grow out of that split identity. Molly Tuttle turned it into a career.

## Two Worlds, One Guitar

Growing up in Palo Alto, Tuttle inhabited two musical universes that rarely collided. Her father introduced her to old-time music—Hazel Dickens, Laurie Lewis, the warm warble of traditional folk. But her cousin's recommendation to check out Beck opened a door to something else entirely.

"I listened to *Guero* a billion times," she told Berklee Online. Then came the punk. Operation Ivy. Rancid. Green Day and Blink-182 for the school rock concerts. By high school, she was in a punk band while simultaneously earning recognition as one of the most talented young flatpickers in the country.

"It did feel separate in a way," she explained. "My friends at school I would listen to one kind of music with, and on the weekends I'd play at the pizza parlor with my bluegrass friends."

## The Cover That Says Everything

In 2020, during the isolation of lockdown, Tuttle released *...but i'd rather be with you*—a covers album that laid bare exactly who she is. The tracklist read like a musical autobiography: Grateful Dead, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The National, Harry Styles. And right there in the middle: Rancid's "Olympia, WA."

It shouldn't work. A street punk manifesto about small-town Pacific Northwest DIY culture, filtered through bluegrass picking? But Tuttle didn't try to soften it. She kept the urgency, the defiant energy, and just... played it. Her acoustic arrangement somehow made the song feel more raw, not less.

Lars Frederiksen from Rancid messaged her on Instagram. He loved it.

## Where Punk Goes When It Picks Up a Banjo

This is the thing about punk DNA—it doesn't disappear when the instrument changes. The aggression becomes intensity. The distortion becomes precision. The mosh pit becomes a flatpicking contest, but the energy translates.

Tuttle's guitar work has always carried that edge. She was the first woman to win the International Bluegrass Music Association's Guitar Player of the Year award, and watching her play, you understand why. There's nothing polite about it. She attacks the strings with the same conviction that Tim Armstrong brings to a power chord.

When she formed Golden Highway and released *Crooked Tree* in 2022, followed by *City of Gold*, the bluegrass world crowned her. Grammy wins. Critical acclaim. A generational talent claiming her throne.

## The New Direction

Then came *So Long Little Miss Sunshine* in August 2025, and the bluegrass purists started grumbling. Produced by Jay Joyce (who's worked with Eric Church and Brothers Osborne), it's unambiguously a pop record—west coast sunset vibes, more Fleetwood Mac than Del McCoury.

The opening track "Everything Burns" still rips. "Rosalee" tells a murder ballad story through a modern lens. But gone are the extended picking showcases. Gone is Golden Highway. This is Molly Tuttle doing exactly what she wants, audience expectations be damned.

Sound familiar? That's the most punk thing she's done yet.

## The Through Line

Here's what connects the punk kid at the middle school concert to the Grammy winner making pop records: the refusal to be one thing. The DIY ethos that says you play what moves you, genre boundaries be damned. The intensity that makes her acoustic guitar sound like a weapon regardless of what style she's playing.

Tuttle told interviewers that no matter what she plays, it ends up sounding "kind of bluegrassy—just my own style." The same could be said about the punk. It's not in the distortion or the tempo. It's in the approach. The commitment. The fire.

She's playing Wildlands Festival 2026 in Washington state this summer. Something tells me whether she plays bluegrass standards or her new pop material, that Palo Alto kid who learned Rancid songs from borrowed CDs will still be right there on stage.

**Molly Tuttle's *So Long Little Miss Sunshine* is streaming now. The covers album *...but i'd rather be with you* is worth revisiting just for the Rancid track. Catch her on the 2026 festival circuit.**

*Who else carries punk DNA into unexpected genres? I'm always looking for the next artist who doesn't fit the box. Let me know what I'm missing.*
