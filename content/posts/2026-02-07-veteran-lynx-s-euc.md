There's a certain kind of person who looks at an electric unicycle and thinks "yeah, but what if it could do 70?"

If you're reading this, you might be one of them. And LeaperKim has been listening.

## The Lynx S Dropped Last Month

The [Lynx S officially released on January 9th, 2026](https://forum.electricunicycle.org/topic/41357-lynx-s-released-friday-9th-jan-2026-151v-2700wh-20-tire-94lb/), and it's basically LeaperKim saying "what if we made the original Lynx angrier?" Here's what we're looking at:

- **Motor:** 3,800W nominal / 10,000W peak
- **Battery:** Samsung 50S cells, 2,700Wh at 151V
- **Wheel:** 20-inch tire
- **Weight:** 94 lbs (yeah, it's a beast)
- **Top Speed:** 65-70 MPH real-world estimates

That motor is 25% more powerful than the original Lynx. LeaperKim claims it has "the widest magnets of any EUC ever made," which sounds like marketing speak until you realize it translates to actual torque you can feel when accelerating from a dead stop.

## The Suspension Situation

But here's where it gets interesting. The EUC community has been obsessing over the Lynx S suspension, and early riders aren't holding back:

The new shock system runs compression and rebound on both sides with a lower air chamber for fine-tuning preload adjustments (recommended 2-3.5 bar). Users on the forums are saying it might be "the most comfortable suspension on any EUC ever made."

That's a big claim in a world that includes the InMotion V14 and Begode's suspension lineup. But the structural improvements back it up - [less frame flex, instant response to inputs](https://nextgenmobility.org/products/leaperkim-lynx-s-electric-unicycle-151v-3800w), and the kind of stiffness that high-speed riders actually want.

## Why This Matters Beyond the Specs

The EUC market in 2026 is weird. You've got [Begode pumping out wheels](https://alienrides.com/collections/electric-unicycles) at every price point and speed tier. KingSong is in flux, working on the F22 after the S19 and S16 Pro refresh. InMotion keeps doing their one-flagship-per-year thing.

And then there's LeaperKim with the Veteran line, just... building absolute units for people who want the fastest, most capable wheels available.

The Lynx S isn't for beginners. It's not even for most intermediate riders. It's for the riders who've already pushed their current wheel to the limit and want more headroom. More power to carve harder. More suspension travel for worse roads. More speed when the path opens up.

At 94 pounds, you're not casually throwing this in your trunk. This is a destination wheel - you're riding *to* somewhere, not just running errands.

## The Pre-Order Wait

If you want one, you're looking at [pre-orders with ETAs in mid-February](https://e-rides.us/product/leaperkim-lynx-s/). Expect to drop somewhere in the $4,000+ range, though exact retail pricing varies by retailer.

Is it worth it? Depends on whether you're the kind of person who needs 70 MPH on one wheel.

For some of us, that's not even a question.

*What's your take on the new performance EUCs? Are we hitting diminishing returns on speed, or is there always room for more power?*
