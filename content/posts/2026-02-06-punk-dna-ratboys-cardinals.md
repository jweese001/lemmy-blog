Here's the thing about punk: the best stuff never stayed in its lane. The Clash went reggae. Hüsker Dü got melodic. And now in 2026, you'll find punk's restless energy living in places you might not expect—country-tinged indie rock from Chicago, moody Celtic post-punk from Cork.

Two albums dropping this month prove the point.

## Ratboys: Therapy Sessions and Twang

Chicago's Ratboys just released *Singin' to an Empty Chair* on February 6th via New West Records, and it's the kind of record that makes you wonder why more bands don't blur lines this confidently.

The album title comes from an actual therapy exercise—singer Julia Steiner started doing "empty chair" work to process an estranged relationship, and that raw honesty bleeds through every track. This isn't polished Nashville crossover stuff. It's indie folk crashing into punk crashing into post-country, produced by Chris Walla of Death Cab for Cutie fame.

They recorded part of it in Wisconsin's Driftless Region, the rest at Electrical Audio in Chicago. The sound reflects that split: delicate acoustic passages that build into angular, frenetic explosions. Track "Burn It Down" opens with country-tinged instrumentation before Steiner's voice hardens into something caustic, demanding "hands off our fucking mouths."

That's punk energy wearing different clothes.

What I appreciate about Ratboys is how they've evolved without losing the core. Six albums in, they're still a band that sounds like they have something to prove—dynamic shifts, emotional urgency, a refusal to settle into comfortable formulas.

## Cardinals: Cork's Menacing Post-Punk

Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, Cork's Cardinals are about to drop their debut album *Masquerade* on February 13th via So Young Records.

This six-piece moves from "the brittle honesty of folk to the theatrical melodrama of goth-rock," according to frontman Euan Manning. The album concept is about "peeling back the masquerade—the facade we all put up." Heavy stuff, delivered through a sound that channels Echo and the Bunnymen's atmospheric bluster alongside Yo La Tengo's scratchy indie sensibilities.

Their single "The Burning of Cork" is the record at its most menacing—named after the 1920 Black and Tan attack on Cork City. They're not just making moody rock; they're channeling local history and trauma into something urgent.

What makes Cardinals feel punk isn't the tempo or the distortion—it's the ethos. Six musicians from Cork building something theatrical and ambitious, ready to release on vinyl, CD, and cassette (cassette!), about to hit UK, Ireland, and US tours including Kilby Block Party in May.

## The Through Line

Here's what connects these two bands, separated by an ocean and technically different genres: neither sounds like they're chasing trends. Ratboys could've gone full Nashville-polished for their New West debut. Cardinals could've sanded down their edges for broader appeal.

Instead, both are making exactly the records they want to make—personal, ambitious, a little uncomfortable in the best way.

That's the punk lineage worth tracing. Not three chords and safety pins, but the stubborn insistence on authenticity even when it's commercially inconvenient.

**What bands are you hearing punk DNA in these days?** I'm always hunting for artists who carry that spirit into unexpected territory—drop your recommendations.
