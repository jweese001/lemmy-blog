---

There's a moment at every Old Crow Medicine Show concert—right around the third song, when Ketch Secor is attacking his fiddle like it owes him money—where you realize you're not at a bluegrass show. You're at a punk show that happens to have banjos.

The band has never hidden this DNA. "We just knew we wanted to combine the technical side of the old sound with the energy of a Nirvana," Secor once explained. That ethos—Appalachian melodies played "fast and hard" with punk intensity—helped spark an entire generation of string-band revivalists, including Mumford & Sons.

## Back to Where the Fire Started

This spring, Old Crow is doing something that cuts straight to the heart of why punk kids pick up fiddles in the first place: The *O.C.M.S. Big Iron World Tour: Back to the Roots*, an 11-city run starting March 18 in Nashville.

But here's what makes it special—they're stripping everything down. Acoustic. Intimate venues. Playing their first two albums (*O.C.M.S.* and *Big Iron World*) in their entirety, exactly as they wrote them over two decades ago. No production tricks. No stadium distance. Just songs built to carry their own weight.

"It's hard to believe it's been 22 years since the launch of our O.C.M.S. album," Secor said. Those early recordings, produced by David Rawlings with Gillian Welch present in the sessions, capture that raw moment when punk energy collided with string-band tradition.

## The Devil's in the Details

Meanwhile, The Devil Makes Three is carrying the same torch from a different angle. Their latest album *Spirits*, recorded in a converted church studio in Woodstock, was produced by Ted Hutt—the same guy who shaped records for Dropkick Murphys and Violent Femmes.

That's not a coincidence. When your folk-blues record is helmed by someone who cut his teeth on Celtic punk anthems, you get something different. *Spirits* tackles loss, mortality, economic disparity, and political division with the unflinching honesty that punk demanded but through the acoustic palette of Americana.

The Devil Makes Three describes themselves as blending "americana, folk, bluegrass, old time, country, blues, jazz, punk and ragtime." It sounds like a joke genre mashup, but seeing them live—they're at Boulder Theater on March 1—you realize it's actually a mission statement. Take the raw energy of a basement show and run it through a standup bass.

## Why It Matters

There's something happening in these collisions that goes beyond genre exercises. When Trampled by Turtles rips through their frenetic bluegrass—their 2026 tour hits 23 cities across North America—they're tapping into the same energy that drove hardcore bands: fast, loud, relentless, but with an acoustic intimacy that lets you hear every picked note.

These aren't punk bands playing country songs, and they're not country bands cosplaying rebellion. They're musicians who absorbed punk's DIY ethos, its intensity, its refusal to be polite—and then picked up fiddles instead of Fenders.

The old bluegrassers might still grumble that it's not *real* bluegrass. The punk purists might scoff at the lack of distortion. Good. That means something interesting is happening in the space between.

*Have you caught any of these shows? Which band best captures that punk-meets-roots energy? Drop me a line—I'm always hunting for the next sound that doesn't fit the box.*
