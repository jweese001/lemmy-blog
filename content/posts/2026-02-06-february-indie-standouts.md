February's the shortest month, but indie devs apparently didn't get the memo. My backlog is already crying and we're barely a week in. Here are three games that grabbed my attention and haven't let go.

## Relooted: The Heist Game We Needed

Let's start with the one that made me put down my controller and just think for a minute. **Relooted** dropped on February 10th, and its premise hits different: you're leading heists to steal African artifacts back from Western museums.

Yeah. That's the game.

The Africanfuturist aesthetic is gorgeous—neon-drenched visuals mixed with cultural motifs that feel fresh and intentional. But it's not just style over substance. The gameplay loop has you recruiting crew members, planning escape routes, and executing increasingly elaborate schemes to reclaim what was taken. It's on Game Pass too, so there's zero excuse not to check it out.

What strikes me most is how the game treats its subject matter with weight without becoming preachy. You're not sitting through lectures—you're pulling off heists while the context sits in your gut. That's good design.

## Dead Pets: Punk Rock Meets Life Sim

Speaking of games that mash genres in ways that shouldn't work but absolutely do: **Dead Pets: A Punk Rock Slice of Life Sim** landed on February 6th.

You play a punk rocker balancing band practice, a waitressing gig, and—here's where it gets wild—trying to steal back your band's album from a label that screwed you over. The game blends narrative adventure with rhythm mechanics, and the pixel art aesthetic oozes personality.

I'm a sucker for games that let me live in a scene rather than just observe it. Dead Pets feels like hanging out at a basement show, complete with all the chaos, frustration, and small victories that come with DIY music. If you've ever tried to keep a band together while paying rent, this one's going to hit close to home.

## MENACE: Battle Brothers Goes to Space

Okay, here's the one for the tactics nerds. **MENACE** came from the developers behind Battle Brothers, and if that name means something to you, you're probably already sold.

This is a turn-based tactical RPG set in a gritty sci-fi frontier. You command a strike force of marines, mercenaries, and specialists responding to distress calls across hostile territory. There's an alien threat, there's squad management, and there's the kind of strategic depth that makes you stare at your screen for way too long deciding whether to risk one more push.

What I appreciate is how the Battle Brothers DNA shows through—the emphasis on consequences, the weight of decisions, the way losing a squadmate actually stings. But the sci-fi setting opens up new possibilities. Different enemy types, new tactical options, and an atmosphere that feels lived-in rather than generic.

## The Indie Landscape in 2026

This month feels like a statement. Indies aren't just filling gaps between AAA releases anymore—they're setting the agenda. When a heist game can tackle colonial museum theft with both style and substance, when a life sim captures punk rock authenticity better than most music games, when tactics veterans can reinvent themselves in new genres—that's a scene that's thriving.

There's also Demon Tides for open-world platformer fans, Starsand Island if you need something cozy, and Death Howl blending deckbuilding with open-world exploration. February's got range.

**What indie gems have you been playing this month?** Drop your recommendations—I'm always looking for the next discovery that makes me forget about my backlog.
