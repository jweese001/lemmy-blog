## The Shell Heard Round the World

Remember when finding a kava bar meant booking a flight to Florida? Those days are officially over.

I've been tracking the kava scene for a while now, and 2026 is shaping up to be the year this thing goes truly national. We're talking Texas rooftop patios, Colorado Springs bar crawls, Atlanta becoming a legitimate destination—this isn't a regional curiosity anymore. It's a movement.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

Here's what we're looking at: the kava bar count in the US went from around 20 establishments in 2011 to over 300 by 2023. The global kava extract market is projected to grow at nearly 18% annually through 2031. Franchises like Kava Culture and Ohana Kava Bar are expanding aggressively, bringing that Pacific Island chill to strip malls and downtown districts alike.

But beyond the business metrics, something cultural is happening. Nearly half of Americans are actively trying to drink less alcohol, according to Circana research. Millennials and Gen Z are drinking at lower rates than their parents did at the same age. People want the social experience of going out—just without the hangover and the 3 AM decisions they'll regret.

Enter kava.

## Fresh Openings Worth Knowing About

**Frisco, Texas**: Kava Culture just opened in the Frisco Rail District in January. Ray and Ruselle Hass are running this franchise location, and here's what caught my attention—it has a rooftop patio. That's a vibe shift from the typical basement-lounge aesthetic. Texas heat plus kava buzz plus open sky? I'm curious how that plays.

**Jacksonville, Florida**: Riverside Kava Bar is building out a 1,200-square-foot space on King Street. Florida remains the mothership of American kava culture, and Jacksonville is getting another serious spot.

**Colorado Springs**: This is the one that really got me. Kava Works just opened their second location downtown at 111 East Pikes Peak Avenue. Owner Jason Benjamin made a point I love: "Downtown Colorado Springs has long needed more alcohol-free options—and now, with two kava spots open, you can even barhop between them." He's talking about Ohana Kava Bar on Boulder Street, just half a mile away.

A kava crawl. In Colorado Springs. Two spots within walking distance. That's scene infrastructure right there.

**Atlanta**: The AJC is covering kava bars as a legitimate trend now, with spots like Kava Mama drawing attention for both the experience and the cultural responsibility angle—honoring kava's Pacific Island roots while building something new.

## The Franchise Factor

Ohana Kava Bar has been at this since 2015, pioneering the first and second kava spots in Colorado. Now they're franchising. Kava Culture, established in 2020, has already spread from Florida to California, Texas, Ohio, and Michigan. Nectar Lab and Island Vibes are getting into the franchise game too.

Some purists worry about what happens when kava goes corporate. Fair concern. But the reality is that franchises bring accessibility—and the better ones seem genuinely committed to quality sourcing and authentic preparation. The vibe might vary, but the shell hits the same.

## Why This Matters

Look, I could write about kava as a trendy beverage or a smart business opportunity. But what actually matters is that we're watching a new kind of third place emerge—somewhere between home and work where people can gather, unwind, and connect without alcohol being the centerpiece.

The Pacific Island cultures that gave us kava understood this. The communal shell wasn't just about the drink; it was about the ritual of sharing, of slowing down, of being present with other people.

That's translating surprisingly well to American strip malls and downtown storefronts. Who knew?

## Your Turn

I want to hear from you. Has a kava bar opened in your city? Are you a regular somewhere, or still kava-curious? Drop a comment or hit me up—I'm always looking for spots to add to the crawl list.

And if you're in Colorado Springs, do me a favor: hit both Kava Works and Ohana in one night and report back. I need to know if the first American kava bar crawl lives up to the hype.
