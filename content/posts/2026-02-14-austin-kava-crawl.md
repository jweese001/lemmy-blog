Austin has earned its reputation as a city of bars. But what if you want the social scene without the hangover? What if you're sober-curious, training for something, or just tired of waking up feeling like garbage after a Tuesday night out?

Welcome to the Austin Kava Crawl.

I've mapped out a route through four of Austin's best kava spots, each with its own distinct vibe. Start in the afternoon, end after midnight, and wake up feeling like a human being. Here's how to do it right.

## Stop 1: SquareRüt (Oak Hill) — The OG

**Address:** 7017 W Hwy 71, Suite C  
**Hours:** 8am–10pm  
**Vibe:** Neighborhood coffee shop meets kava lounge

If Austin's kava scene has a founding father, it's SquareRüt. Scott and Tracy discovered kava in 2008 and opened their first location in 2011 with a simple mission: make kava as normal as coffee. They've been at it for over fifteen years now, and walking into their Oak Hill spot feels like visiting an old friend's living room.

**What to order:** Start with the *Aolani* strain from Vanuatu — it's cerebral and focused, perfect for easing into the crawl. Not too sedative, just enough to smooth out the edges. Pair it with one of their fresh-baked pastries (they source local) and maybe a coffee if you need the kick.

**Pro tip:** They recently added pizza to the menu. Yes, pizza and kava. It works better than you'd think.

## Stop 2: Lazy Bones Kava — The Hangout

**Address:** 2110 S Lamar Blvd, Suite A  
**Hours:** 8am–1am  
**Vibe:** Your friend's garage if your friend was really into Pacific culture

Head south on Lamar and you'll find Lazy Bones, a health-conscious, pet-friendly spot that takes its "empowering community" mission seriously. This place feels lived-in: there's a pool table, board games, and a rotating cast of regulars who actually know each other's names.

**What to order:** Their traditional kava preparation is solid — they do it the old-school way. But if you want something easier on the palate, try one of their botanical mocktails. They've got a full tea menu too.

**Why it matters:** Lazy Bones opens at 8am and doesn't close until 1am. That's 17 hours of operation. You could technically do your entire workday here and still have time for a few shells before closing. The 4.54-star rating on BestKavaBar isn't an accident — people stick around because it feels like somewhere to *be*, not just somewhere to drink.

## Stop 3: Neshama Kava — The Spiritual Pit Stop

**Address:** 1701 Toomey Rd (inside Casa de Luz village)  
**Hours:** 1pm–11pm (weekends)  
**Vibe:** Wellness retreat meets boutique shop

This one's a vibe shift. Neshama sits inside the Casa de Luz compound — that eco-village in 78704 that regularly makes "hippest zip code" lists. The energy here is intentional. People come for breathwork brunches and open mic nights. The space stocks organic clothing, eco-friendly home goods, and jewelry alongside the kava.

**What to order:** Keep it simple. A shell or two, then wander the grounds. This isn't the place to pound kava — it's the place to slow down mid-crawl, reset your intentions, and maybe buy some ethically-sourced incense while you're at it.

**Best for:** The moment in the afternoon when you realize you've been going all day and need twenty minutes of quiet before the night portion begins.

## Stop 4: Tulum Botanical — The Late Night Finish

**Address:** 1620 E 7th St  
**Hours:** 12pm–12am  
**Vibe:** Tropical escape, East Austin energy

Tulum is the newest addition to Austin's kava scene and it shows. The space leans hard into that Riviera Maya aesthetic — think lush plants, warm lighting, and that specific vibe where everything moves a little slower. It's Austin's freshest spot for relaxation, and they've built in community events from the start: open mic comedy, live music, creative gatherings.

**What to order:** Whatever's on special. Tulum's strength is atmosphere, and their menu rotates to match. Grab a seat, let the evening unfold.

**Why end here:** The hours. Tulum stays open until midnight, making it the natural final stop on the crawl. You can close the place down and still make it home at a reasonable hour, clear-headed and ready for tomorrow.

## The Route

**Start:** 2pm at SquareRüt Oak Hill  
**Mid-afternoon:** 4pm at Lazy Bones (grab some pool)  
**Sunset:** 6pm at Neshama (breathe, browse, recalibrate)  
**Night:** 8pm onward at Tulum (ride out the evening)  
**Home by:** Midnight-ish, functional

**Total distance:** About 15 miles if you take rideshare between spots. Budget $40-50 for Ubers across the day, less if you've got a designated driver.

## What Makes Austin's Scene Work

Most cities have one or two kava spots. Austin has *options*. You can get community-minded Pacific authenticity at Lazy Bones, spiritual intention at Neshama, Tulum-inspired tropical vibes in East Austin, and straight-up OG reliability at SquareRüt — all in one day, without repeating yourself.

The through-line is the sober-curious momentum. These aren't bars masquerading as kava joints. They're built from the ground up around the idea that social drinking doesn't require alcohol. That the "third place" between home and work can involve something other than IPAs and overpriced cocktails.

Austin figured this out before most cities did. SquareRüt opened in 2011. The rest of the country is just now catching up.
